# **Order Management Microservice**

## **Overview**

The Order Management is a robust, scalable backend service built using NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka. It is designed to handle order management for various storefronts globally, managing millions of customers, products, and orders efficiently. The microservice architecture and AWS deployment strategies ensure scalability, high availability, and security.

## **Features**

- **Order Management**: Create, update, and delete orders, including order statuses and shipping information.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle millions of orders globally with microservice-based design.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Kafka integration for handling order-related events asynchronously.
- **Caching**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data, reducing load on the database.
- **Rate Limiting**: Integrated rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure service stability.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Messaging**: Kafka
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS ECS, AWS Fargate, Terraform for IaC
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions


## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js** v22 or higher
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Terraform** for infrastructure management
- **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate permissions
- **GitHub Account** with access to GitHub Actions

### **Running the Project Locally**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrustaylor90/order-management-service.git
   cd order-management-service
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run Tests**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. **Run the Application Locally**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

The service will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### **Deploying to AWS ECS/Fargate**

The deployment process uses Terraform to set up the AWS infrastructure, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and AWS ECS for running the application.

1. **Set Up AWS Infrastructure with Terraform**

    Navigate to the infra directory and apply Terraform scripts.
   ```bash
    cd infra
    terraform init
    terraform apply
   ```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**

    The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application to AWS on every push to the main branch.

    Build: Compiles the TypeScript code and builds Docker images.
    Test: Runs all unit and integration tests.
    Deploy: Pushes the Docker image to AWS ECR and deploys the service on ECS.

## **Extending the Features**

1. **Enhance Order Processing with More Integrations**

    - Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate with payment providers like Stripe or PayPal to handle order payments.
    - Inventory Sync: Connect to third-party inventory systems for real-time stock updates.
    - Notification Services: Add email/SMS notifications for order updates using AWS SNS.

2. **Performance Optimization**
    - Database Indexing: Optimize database performance by adding indexes to frequently queried fields.
    - Query Caching: Use Redis to cache database query results, reducing the load on the database.
    - Optimize Kafka Consumers: Implement batch processing in Kafka consumers to handle high loads efficiently.

3. **Advanced Security Enhancements**
    - OAuth2 Authentication: Implement OAuth2 for secure API access, especially when integrating third-party services.
    - Data Encryption: Ensure all data at rest (RDS, Redis) and in transit (API Gateway) is encrypted.
    - AWS WAF: Implement AWS WAF to protect against SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.

4. **Observability and Monitoring**
    - Distributed Tracing: Use AWS X-Ray or OpenTelemetry to trace requests across distributed systems for better visibility.
    - Enhanced Logging: Implement structured logging with context IDs to improve log traceability and debugging.
    - CloudWatch Dashboards: Set up custom CloudWatch dashboards for real-time monitoring of key metrics.

## **AWS Deployment Strategy**

### **Infrastructure**

- API Gateway: Exposes microservice endpoints, handles API routing, throttling, and authorization.
- ECS with Fargate: Deploys Dockerized microservices for easy scaling and management.
- RDS: Managed PostgreSQL service with automated backups and multi-AZ deployment for high availability.
- Redis (ElastiCache): Provides in-memory caching for faster data retrieval and performance.
- Kafka (MSK): Managed Kafka service for robust event-driven architecture and messaging.

### **Scalability & High Availability**

- Auto-Scaling: Configure ECS to scale based on CPU and memory usage to handle increased loads.
- Load Balancer: Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly across ECS tasks.
- Multi-AZ Deployment: Deploy services across multiple availability zones for improved fault tolerance.

### **Security**

- VPC: Deploy within a Virtual Private Cloud for network isolation.
- IAM Roles: Use IAM roles and policies to secure access to AWS resources.
- Secrets Manager: Store and manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials securely.
- AWS WAF: Protects the service from web exploits and bots.

### **Continuous Improvement**

- Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor service performance and tune auto-scaling and load balancing settings.
- Cost Optimization: Use AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor to identify cost-saving opportunities.
- Feature Enhancements: Regularly update the microservice with new features, performance improvements, and security patches.
